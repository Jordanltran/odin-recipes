  <p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Pesto</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>30 grams pine nuts, lightly toasted + cooled
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt
    <li>1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
    <li>30 grams basil leaves, washed + dried
    <li>20 grams Parmesan Reggiano, finely grated
    <li>10 grams Pecorino Romano, finely grated
    <li>80 ml extra virgin olive oil
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  <h4>Trenette al Pesto</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Tablespoon kosher salt
    <li>300 grams yellow-skin potatoes, peeled
    <li>150 grams green beans, washed, trimmed
    <li>450 grams dried fettuccine pasta or dried trenette pasta
    <li>Pesto (see recipe above)
    <li>Drizzle extra virgin olive oil
    <li>3-4 basil leaves
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <h4>Pesto Method</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the garlic, salt, and pine nuts to the mortar. Using the pestle, muddle the ingredients in a circular motion until it becomes a paste.
    <li>Add the basil leaves to the mortar. Using the pestle, pound the leaves into the garlic paste. If the leaves are taking a while to break down, add a splash of olive oil.
    <li>Once the basil has broken down, add the cheese. Add a small amount of oil at a time, pounding in between to combine the pesto. Tip: If your pesto begins to break, add another sprinkling of grated cheese.
    <li>Alternatively, combine the garlic, salt, and pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until the nuts are finely chopped. Add the basil leaves and the cheeses. While the machine is running, stream in the olive oil.
    <li>Use immediately or store the pesto in an airtight container. Before closing the lid, add a thin layer of olive oil on top of the pesto to prevent discoloring. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h4>Trenette al Pesto Method</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the kosher salt to season the water.
    <li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into 1-inch cubes.
    <li>Cut the green beans into 1-inch pieces.
    <li>Once the water is boiling, add potatoes and cook for 4 minutes. Add the dried fettuccine pasta and cook for an additional 10-11 minutes or until the pasta is al dente. In the last 3-4 minutes of cooking, add the green beans. Towards the end of cooking, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking liquid. <strong><em>If using dried trenette pasta, add the potatoes and cook for 10 minutes, then add the green beans and allow them to cook for an additional 2 minutes. Then, add the pasta and cook for just 2 more minutes.</em></strong>
    <li>Drain the pasta/potatoes/beans once cooked.
    <li>Add the pesto to a large bowl. Add the drained pasta/potatoes/beans and about Â¼ of the reserved pasta water. Toss to combine the pasta.
    <li>Finish the pasta with olive oil and garnish with more basil leaves.
  </ol>
